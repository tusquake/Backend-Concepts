## 1. API Gateway Pattern

### What is it?
An API Gateway acts as a single entry point for all client requests to your microservices.

### Real-World Analogy: Hotel Reception Desk
Imagine you're staying at a large hotel with many departments (restaurant, housekeeping, spa, room service). Instead of calling each department directly, you call the reception desk. The receptionist knows how to route your request to the right department and gives you a unified response.

**Without API Gateway:** You need to know the phone number of every department (restaurant: 555-0101, spa: 555-0102, etc.)

**With API Gateway:** You only need to know one number (reception: 555-0100), and they handle routing your request.

### Why Use It?
- Clients only need to know one address
- Simplifies authentication and security
- Can transform requests/responses for different clients (mobile vs web)
- Reduces the number of round trips

## 2. Service Discovery Pattern

### What is it?
Service Discovery allows microservices to find and communicate with each other automatically, even as their locations change.

### Real-World Analogy: Phone Directory / GPS Navigation
Think of a phone directory or GPS system. When you want to call a pizza place, you don't memorize their address—you look it up in a directory. If the pizza place moves, the directory updates automatically.

**Without Service Discovery:** You hardcode "Pizza Palace is at 123 Main Street." If they move, your app breaks.

**With Service Discovery:** You ask "Where is Pizza Palace?" and get the current address, wherever they are.

### Why Use It?
- Services can move or scale without breaking connections
- Automatic health checking
- Load balancing across multiple instances
- Works great in cloud environments where instances come and go

## 3. Circuit Breaker Pattern

### What is it?
A Circuit Breaker prevents your application from repeatedly trying to perform an operation that's likely to fail, giving the failing service time to recover.

### Real-World Analogy: Electrical Circuit Breaker
Your home has circuit breakers that trip when there's an electrical overload. Instead of letting wires overheat and start a fire, the breaker cuts power temporarily. Once the problem is fixed, you can reset it.

**Scenario:** Your payment service is down.

**Without Circuit Breaker:** Your app keeps trying to process payments every second, making 1000s of failed attempts, overwhelming the already struggling service.

**With Circuit Breaker:** After 5 failed attempts, the circuit "trips." For the next 60 seconds, requests fail immediately with a helpful message, giving the payment service time to recover.

### States:
- **Closed:** Everything works normally
- **Open:** Too many failures detected, stop trying
- **Half-Open:** Testing if the service has recovered

---

## 4. Saga Pattern

### What is it?
A Saga manages distributed transactions across multiple services by breaking them into smaller steps, with compensation actions if something fails.

### Real-World Analogy: Booking a Vacation Package
When booking a vacation, you need to:
1. Reserve a flight
2. Book a hotel
3. Rent a car
4. Pay for everything

What if the payment fails after you've booked everything?

**Without Saga:** You're stuck with reservations but no payment—manual cleanup nightmare.

**With Saga:** The system automatically:
- Cancels your car rental
- Releases your hotel reservation
- Cancels your flight
- All in the correct reverse order

### Two Types:
- **Choreography:** Each service knows what to do next (like dancers following choreography)
- **Orchestration:** One coordinator tells each service what to do (like a conductor)

---

## 5. Event Sourcing Pattern

### What is it?
Instead of storing just the current state of data, Event Sourcing stores every change (event) that led to the current state.

### Real-World Analogy: Bank Account Statement
Your bank doesn't just show your current balance ($1,500). It shows every transaction:
- Started with: $2,000
- Coffee: -$5
- Salary: +$3,000
- Rent: -$1,500
- Groceries: -$150
- **Current balance: $1,500**

**Benefits:**
- Complete audit trail (you can see every change)
- Time travel (what was the balance on March 15th?)
- Rebuild state from scratch
- Debug issues ("When did this change?")

### Example:
**Traditional:** User profile = {name: "John", email: "john@email.com"}

**Event Sourcing:**
- UserCreated(name: "Jon", email: "jon@email.com")
- NameCorrected(old: "Jon", new: "John")
- EmailUpdated(new: "john@email.com")

---

## 6. CQRS Pattern (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

### What is it?
CQRS separates reading data (queries) from writing data (commands), using different models for each.

### Real-World Analogy: Restaurant Kitchen vs Menu
When you read a menu (query), you see beautiful descriptions: "Grilled Atlantic Salmon with lemon butter sauce, seasonal vegetables, and wild rice."

In the kitchen (command), the chef sees: "1x SALMON-GRILL, SAUCE-02, VEG-MIX, RICE-WILD."

Same information, different formats optimized for different purposes.

**For Writing (Commands):**
- Strict validation
- Business rules enforced
- Normalized data structure

**For Reading (Queries):**
- Fast retrieval
- Denormalized for quick access
- Optimized for display

### Example:
**Writing:** Creating an order validates inventory, checks payment, updates multiple tables

**Reading:** Displaying order history just reads from a pre-built, flat summary table

---

## 7. Database per Service Pattern

### What is it?
Each microservice has its own private database that only it can access directly.

### Real-World Analogy: Personal Lockers in a Gym
Everyone at the gym has their own locker with their own key. You can't access someone else's locker directly. If you need something from them, you have to ask them to get it for you.

**Without this pattern:** All services share one giant database (like everyone throwing their stuff in one big pile)

**With this pattern:** Each service manages its own data (like individual lockers)

### Why Use It?
- Services can't break each other's data
- Each service can choose its own database type (SQL, NoSQL, etc.)
- Easier to scale individual services
- Teams can work independently

### Trade-off:
Joining data across services is harder—you need to make API calls instead of database joins.

## 8. Strangler Fig Pattern

### What is it?
A gradual approach to replacing an old system by slowly building a new system around it.

### Real-World Analogy: Strangler Fig Tree
The strangler fig grows around an existing tree, using it for support. Over time, the fig becomes self-sufficient and eventually the original tree dies away, leaving a hollow fig tree in its place.

### How It Works:
**Year 1:** Old monolithic app handles 100% of traffic

**Year 2:**
- New microservice handles user authentication (20% of features)
- Old app handles everything else (80%)

**Year 3:**
- New microservices handle authentication + payments + orders (60%)
- Old app handles the rest (40%)

**Year 4:**
- New microservices handle everything (100%)
- Old app retired ☠️

### Why Use It?
- Less risky than "big bang" rewrites
- Can continue serving customers during migration
- Learn as you go
- Can abandon the effort if needed

## 9. Sidecar Pattern

### What is it?
A Sidecar is a helper service that runs alongside your main service, providing supporting functionality.

### Real-World Analogy: Motorcycle Sidecar
A motorcycle sidecar attaches to a motorcycle. The motorcycle does its main job (transportation), while the sidecar provides additional functionality (carrying a passenger or luggage) without modifying the motorcycle itself.

### Common Uses:
- **Logging:** Sidecar collects and sends logs
- **Monitoring:** Sidecar tracks health metrics
- **Security:** Sidecar handles encryption
- **Configuration:** Sidecar manages settings

### Example:
Your main app focuses on processing orders. A sidecar handles:
- Sending logs to a central system
- Reporting metrics
- Managing SSL certificates

### Why Use It?
- Main service stays focused on its core job
- Sidecar functionality can be reused across services
- Can update sidecar without changing main service
- Works in any programming language

## 10. Backends for Frontends (BFF) Pattern

### What is it?
Create separate backend services customized for different types of clients (web, mobile, smart TV, etc.).

### Real-World Analogy: Restaurant Menus for Different Audiences
The same restaurant might have:
- **Regular menu:** Full descriptions, multiple pages
- **Kids menu:** Simple words, pictures, smaller portions
- **Drive-thru menu:** Large text, limited options for quick ordering
- **Dietary restrictions menu:** Allergen information highlighted

Same kitchen, different menus for different customers.

### Example Scenario: E-commerce Site

**Mobile BFF:**
- Returns minimal data (smaller screen)
- Optimized images for mobile
- Simplified product info

**Web BFF:**
- Returns detailed product info
- High-res images
- More filtering options

**Smart TV BFF:**
- Large navigation tiles
- Video content emphasized
- Remote-control friendly

### Why Use It?
- Each client gets exactly what it needs
- Reduces over-fetching data
- Frontend teams can evolve their BFF independently
- Better performance for each platform

## Quick Decision Guide

**Use API Gateway when:** You want a single entry point for multiple microservices

**Use Service Discovery when:** Services need to find each other in dynamic environments

**Use Circuit Breaker when:** You need to handle service failures gracefully

**Use Saga when:** You have transactions spanning multiple services

**Use Event Sourcing when:** You need a complete audit trail of all changes

**Use CQRS when:** Your read and write patterns are very different

**Use Database per Service when:** You want services to be truly independent

**Use Strangler Fig when:** You're migrating from a legacy system

**Use Sidecar when:** You need to add cross-cutting functionality

**Use BFF when:** Different clients need different data formats

---

## Combining Patterns

In real projects, you'll often use multiple patterns together:

**E-commerce Example:**
- API Gateway (single entry point)
- Service Discovery (services find each other)
- Circuit Breaker (handle payment service failures)
- Saga (manage order workflow)
- Database per Service (each service owns its data)
- BFF (separate backends for web and mobile)

## Getting Started Tips

1. **Start Small:** Don't implement all patterns at once
2. **Solve Real Problems:** Use patterns when you have the problem they solve
3. **Document Decisions:** Write down why you chose each pattern
4. **Monitor Everything:** Distributed systems are complex—observability is key
5. **Prepare for Failure:** In distributed systems, something is always failing

---

**Remember:** Microservices add complexity. Use these patterns to manage that complexity, but only adopt microservices if you truly need them. Sometimes a well-designed monolith is the better choice!
